This year I was fortunate enough to write a complete course about HTML forms together with the help of [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) and [Sam Dutton](https://twitter.com/sw12).

It has been some intense months of writing and editing, and I am really excited how it turned out.

In total, there are 22 modules.

- [Use forms to get data from users](https://web.dev/learn/forms/form-element/)
