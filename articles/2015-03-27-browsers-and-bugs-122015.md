Itâ€™s friday and thus a new round of Browsers and Bugs is ready for you. Hello and welcome to issue 12. Happy bug reporting!

Browsers, Bugs and Workarounds
------------------------------

### [Intent to Implement: Pointer Events  
](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/m/#!topic/blink-dev/ODWmcKNQl0I)

After a lot of feedback, Chrome is now considering to implement Pointer Events. Meanwhile in Cupertino, Apple invents new events for [force touch](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142836).

### [Partnering with Adobe](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/03/23/partnering-with-adobe-on-new-contributions-to-our-web-platform.aspx)

Adobe have provided contributions in partnership with engineers on the IE team. Good to see that IE is opening a bit and looking for contributions from outside.

### [Status page for WebKit](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2015-March/027351.html)

After [Blink](https://www.chromestatus.com/features) and [Internet Explorer](https://status.modern.ie/) also WebKit is considering building a status page. Would be great to get more information about features in WebKit.

### [New CSS parser for Blink](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/r9bthijsX3A/discussion)

On most stylesheets, the new parser performed 15-25% faster.

Debugging, Testing and more

A proxy to use Chrome Devtools to debug and diagnose IE.

### [Third-parties](http://blog.webperf.ninja/2015/find-third-party-assets/)
