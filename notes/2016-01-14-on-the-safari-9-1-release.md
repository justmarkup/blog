Earlier this week – January 11, 2016 – Apple announced the release of [Safari 9.1](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH10-SW1) which will be available soon is available now. It ships with exciting features – picture element, fast-tap, CSS variables – to name a few. I was as surprised, as other [web developers](https://adactio.com/journal/10084) to see this happen and it makes me happy.  

Safari is the new IE
--------------------

Many web developers have the feeling that Safari is lagging behind other browsers nowadays. On of the reasons is the release cycle of Safari. Until now, a new version of Safari was released only once a year. While other browser vendors release a new version every other month, we – as web developers – had to wait for a long time until features and fixes would land in Safari. I am pleased to see a change happening here and I am looking forward to see more frequent releases in the future.

I am even optimistic now to see Service Worker coming to Safari this year which I wouldn’t have thought it would ever happen [a month ago](https://justmarkup.com/log/2015/12/front-end-wishlist-for-2016/).

And don’t worry, I am sure the internet crowd will soon find another thing which is the new IE.
