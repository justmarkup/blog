Reached the milestone of one decade of publishing. On this day ten years ago, I published my first article on this site.

Since then, I published over 145 articles and notes.

From the ~315.569,520 seconds since I published the first article, I wasted quite some time staring at loading screens, and trying to interact with inaccessible websites. Hopefully, though, saved some seconds for others, by helping developers build faster, and more accessible sites by sharing my knowledge here.

I haven't published a lot during the previous year, and don't really know if this will change again. I still enjoy writing and sharing content, but I don't feel forced anymore to do it. 

Stay safe and on to the next ten years!
