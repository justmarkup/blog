I have a document in [Writerie](https://app.writerie.com) which is called The Void - every time (at least most of the time) I am angry about something or want to complain and would normally tweet it out, I instead write it down in The Void.

This way it is out of the way, and at the same time I don't tweet something stupid I may regret later. Getting it out of my head is very important for me. If I don't write it down, I will think about it again and again and get mad.

The Void helps me here and frees my thoughts.

Happy voiding!
