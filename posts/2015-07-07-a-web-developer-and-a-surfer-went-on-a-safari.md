A surfer and a web developer, both familiar with going on Safari, went on a trip the other day. This time they decided to go with the vendor Banana.

After sitting in the Safari SUV (called the mighty Browser by locals) for some time, the surfer praised the smooth experience on the way and that the car hasn’t broken yet like with other vendors before. It’s such a smart and powerful way to go on Safari with Banana, he said. Furthermore, as Banana is the only company available for this region – it all feels so native, very inimitable, he added. That’s amazing, isn’t it, he asked the web developer.

The web developer, taking a deep breath, before replying in his loudest voice, NO! Don’t you see that all the features, we had with other vendors, are missing on this trip? One company even managed to deliver a great experience after the car went out of petrol, that was awesome, he added.

And thereby ends the story of a grumpy web developer and a happy surfer.
